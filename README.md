# Suite Conway

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the "Look-and-Say" sequence, often referred to as Conway's Sequence. The code was developed as a school exercise for Ada Tech School in August 2024.


## Description

The "Look-and-Say" sequence is a series of numbers where each term is generated by describing the digits of the previous term. For example, starting with the number `1`, the sequence would generate:

```
1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
```

This project provides two main functions:

1. **suiteConway**: Generates the next term in the sequence based on the given input string.
2. **suiteConwaySequence**: Recursively generates and prints each term in the sequence for a specified number of iterations.
